With CSS, developers can apply responsive design techniques to ensure the website adapts to various screen sizes and devices. Media queries enable the creation of breakpoints, allowing the site's layout to adjust gracefully on different screen resolutions. Moreover, CSS can be used to control typography, colors, spacing, and animations, thus enhancing the visual appeal and user experience. Employing Flexbox and CSS Grid provides powerful tools for creating flexible and responsive page layouts."

To improve user-friendliness, JavaScript can be employed to create responsive navigation menus, toggle elements, and handle form validations. Utilizing libraries like jQuery simplifies complex interactions and animations. Moreover, asynchronous JavaScript requests (AJAX) can be implemented to load data without refreshing the entire page, resulting in a smoother and more efficient user experience. However, it's essential to use JavaScript judiciously, optimizing for performance and ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices."
